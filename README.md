# Status Bar Label - Display the current folder name on the status bar.

This extention was created out of the need to display the current root folder name in a consistent place when you use VSCODE in full screen on MacOS with the explorer minimized. The folder name will omly display is the folder includes a 'package.json' file.

## Features

The extention extracts the current directory path, splits the folder name at every '-' interval, it then capitalizes the first leter of every word and joins back with '-'.

## Release Notes

Just displays the current root folder name at the first position on the left of the status bar. The folder name will display if the folder includes a package.json file.
