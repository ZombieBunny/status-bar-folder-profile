# Status Bar Label - Display the current directory name on the status bar.

This extention was created out of the need to display the current root directory name in a consistent place when you use VSCODE in full screen on MacOS with the explorer minimized. The directory name will omly display if the directory includes a 'package.json' file.

## Features

The extention extracts the current directory path, splits the directory name at every '-' interval, it then capitalizes the first leter of every word and joins back with '-'.

## Release Notes

Just displays the current root directory name at the first position on the left of the status bar. The directory name will display if the directory includes a package.json file.

### 0.0.1
